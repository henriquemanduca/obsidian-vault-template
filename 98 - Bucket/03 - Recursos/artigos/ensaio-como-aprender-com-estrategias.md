#### Memory Palace (Method of Loci) 

**What**: Remember lists (names, facts, groceries) by placing each item in a familiar spot in your mind. 
**Why**: Your brain is good at remembering places and images. Combined, the info sticks better.
**How**:
1. Think of a place you know well, like your home. 
2. Walk through it in your mind. Note specific locations.
3. Attach a piece of info to each spot. Make it vivid. 
4. Do a mental walk-thru. Find the info at each spot. 

Tip: Unique & colorful images are easier to recall.

### SKILL DEVELOPMENT

#### Josh Kaufman's 20-Hour Rule:

**What**: It only takes about 20 hours of focused practice to gain a decent skill level in something new. 
**Why**: The 1st hours of learning are the toughest. When you push thru the hard part, you start enjoying the skill. 
**How**:
1. Pick a skill to learn: a language, instrument, coding, etc.
2. Break it down into smaller, manageable parts. 
3. Dedicate 20 hours total to deliberate practice sessions (15 min/day = 80 days; 60 min/day = 20 days; etc.). 

Tip: Stay consistent & committed. It gets easier as you go.

### STUDY STRATEGIES

#### Pomodoro Technique:

**What**: Be more productive & retain more by studying in short, focused intervals with breaks in between.
**Why**: Your brain can only focus well for short periods. Regular breaks refresh and prevent burnout.
**How**:
1. Pick your study task or topic.
2. Set a timer for 25 minutes. This is one "Pomodoro." 
3. Study intensely until the timer goes off.
4. Take a 5-min break. Play a fav song, take a walk, etc. 5. Repeat. After 4 Pomodoros, break for 15-30 mins.

#### Feynman Technique:

**What**: You know a topic well if you can teach it in simple terms, like to a kid.
**How**:
1. Choose a topic.
2. Pretend to teach it.
3. Notice stumbles or gaps.
4. Go back & learn more.
5. Try to explain it again.
